This means that even if you have received this vaccine in the past, even in a previous and recent pregnancy, you should get it again. You should be getting this vaccine after 21 weeks\u2019 gestation and at least 4 weeks before your due date.\n\u2800\nWhen you receive this vaccination in pregnancy, your body makes antibodies that are passed on to your developing baby. When your baby is born, these antibodies will help their body defend against whooping cough, a very contagious illness that poses a serious risk to young babies. This will protect your baby until they can receive their own vaccine at 2 months of age.\n\u2800\nWhen you see your care provider next, ask about the best way for you to get your Tdap vaccine. One option is to add it onto another visit if you happen to see your family doctor any time after 21 weeks, as most family physicians carry this vaccine in their office.\n\u2800\nWhere did you get your whooping cough vaccine during #COVID19?

If untreated, it can increase the risk of pregnancy complications, including: a large baby, preeclampsia, and stillbirth. Therefore, it is important for all pregnant people to get screened for gestational diabetes between 24-28 gestational weeks, or earlier if their care provider determines they have risk factors for the condition.\n\u2800\nThe gold standard screening test is an Oral Glucose Challenge Test (OGCT). This test requires you to consume a standard 50-g sugar drink followed by a blood test 1 hour after. The current pandemic may make it more challenging to access this gold standard test. In response to reduced access or willingness to access hospitals and labs for the OGCT, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) has proposed alternative options for screening that will apply to some patients. To determine the best method of screening for you during #COVID19, you will need to have a discussion with your care provider.\n\u2800\nDid you get an OGCT?

There are no restrictions to climbing stairs, just be careful not to exert yourself too much.\n\u2800\nDriving: To test if you\u2019ve recovered enough to drive safely, check in a parked car whether you are able to slam on the brakes without pain (in case you are in a situation where you need to stop suddenly while driving). Also practice looking back to check your blind spots without pain. You should not drive if you are taking narcotic (opioid) pain medications.\n\u2800\nAlways seek medical attention if you are concerned. Specific reasons that should prompt you to go to the emergency department or speak to your care provider include: heavy bleeding like a period, fever, signs of surgical site infection (persistent and worsening redness, warmth, pain to the touch, or foul-smelling/purulent discharge), persistent and worsening abdominal pain, and/or signs of a blood clot in your leg (one-sided swelling, redness, or pain in the calf region).\n\u2800\nTo all those parents who have had a cesarean section before, what tips do you have for the recovery period?

While this is not a surgical procedure, your body still needs time and care to heal before you resume your normal activities. Check out our recommendations above to help guide you through a safe recovery, including some tips for perineal care.\n\u2800\nYou know your body best, and you should always seek medical attention if you are concerned. Specific reasons to go to the emergency department or speak to your care provider include: heavy bleeding like a period, fever, signs of surgical site infection (persistent and worsening redness, warmth, pain to the touch, or foul-smelling/purulent discharge), persistent/worsening abdominal pain, and/or signs of a blood clot in your leg (one-sided swelling, redness, or pain in the calf region). If you soak more than two pads in an hour or are passing clots larger than a golf ball, get in contact with your healthcare provider.\n\u2800\nIf you had stitches, you should follow the perineal care instructions. The stitches do not require any additional care and will absorb on their own over time. If you have concerns about their healing, please speak to your care provider.\n\u2800\nFor the first 24 hours after a vaginal delivery, we often recommend applying a popsicle pad to the perineum for 10-20 minutes every 1-2 hours. Popsicle pads can be made by running water on an open pad and leaving them open in the freezer until frozen.\n\u2800\nTo all those parents who have had a vaginal delivery before, what tips do you have for the recovery period?

It is a common condition, affecting 5% of all pregnancies.\n\u2800\nYou can develop GHTN even if you have never had high blood pressure before. Risk factors for developing GHTN include: previous history of high BP, personal or family history of high BP during pregnancy, first time pregnancy, and being <20 years old or >40 years old.\n\u2800\nGenerally, care providers will take your blood pressure at every appointment. Given that some prenatal appointments are now happening virtually, your provider may ask you to take your blood pressure at home.\n\u2800\nIf you develop GHTN, it is important for it to be managed by your care provider. If undiagnosed or untreated, it can progress to a more serious condition called preeclampsia. Preeclampsia presents as a combination of high blood pressure and signs or symptoms of organ dysfunction, most often in the liver or kidneys.\n\u2800\nPreeclampsia can present with high blood pressure AND the following symptoms:\n\u2800\n- Headache: Headache can resemble a migraine, characterized by a throbbing sensation and can be accompanied by nausea and photophobia (sensitivity to light) and/or phonophobia (sensitivity to sound). This headache does not resolve with acetaminophen (Tylenol) and can be a warning sign of a seizure.\n\u2800\n- Visual changes: blurry vision, flashing light, spots\n\u2800\n- Abdominal pain: right upper or central upper (epigastric) pain which may feel similar to heartburn but is not relieved with heartburn medication\n\u2800\nIt is very important for you to seek medical care if you develop symptoms of preeclampsia.

Dr. Martin is a staff anesthetist and the lead for obstetrical anesthesia at St. Michael\u2019s Hospital.\n\u2800\nIn summary, nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is not being offered for labour pain currently in many hospitals and birthing centres. This is because its administration can potentially cause aerosolization of respiratory particles which can increase the risk of transmission of COVID19.\n\u2800\nDr. Martin also discussed epidurals for pain management in labour. In general, epidurals are safe for you and your baby, and provide effective pain management with few side effects. Another benefit of a labour epidural is that if a cesarean section is needed in an emergency, the epidural can be used for cesarean section and you can avoid having a general anesthetic, which is an aerosolizing procedure and thus can increase the risk of transmission of COVID19. It is important to note that due to COVID19, there are extra precautions that healthcare professionals have to take when providing general anesthesia and this can slow down the process and increase the risks to you and your baby. Therefore, an epidural can help facilitate delivering your baby as quickly as possible by cesarean section if needed.\n\u2800\nWhat techniques and tips helped you manage pain in labour that might help our parents-to-be?

Consuming less than than 200 mg of caffeine per day, across all sources of caffeine - including some chocolates, teas, and other foods and beverages - is safe. This generally translates to 1-2 small cups of coffee a day. As an example, a small Tim Horton\u2019s coffee contains 140 mg of caffeine while a medium contains 205 mgs. A short Starbucks Medium Roast coffee contains 155 mg of caffeine while a tall contains 235 mg of caffeine.\n\u2800\nIt is also recommended for you to avoid energy drinks since they contain high amounts of caffeine and ingredients which have not been tested for their safety in pregnancy. \u2800\n\u2800\nCaffeine can also contribute to or worsen symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn), a condition which can develop or worsen in pregnancy. If you are experiencing these symptoms, it may be best to avoid or reduce your caffeine intake.\n\u2800\nAs a side note, although some herbal teas are decaffeinated, there are certain herbal teas which are not recommended during pregnancy. These include: Aloe, Buckthorn Bark, Chamomile, Coltsfoot, Comfrey, Duck Roots, Juniper berries, Labrador Tea, Lobelia, Pennyroyal, Sassafras, and Senna Leaves. Check with your care provider before consuming herbal tea.\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #pregnancy #maternity #birth #newborn #maternalheath #primarycare #obstetrics #coronavirus #physicaldistancing\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

We\u2019re getting things started with a few ideas, but please comment below to share tips for supporting expecting/new parents during the #COVID19 pandemic.\n\u2800\nWe are also aware that not everyone is going through pregnancy with a partner. These tips apply equally to family & friends who want to support a new/expecting parent.\n\u2800\nMoreover, we recognize that the possibility of giving birth without a support person is distressing and upsetting. We want to emphasize that this is unlikely, while also acknowledging the reality of the current public health emergency & how it might impact you. For the most recent statement from the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada regarding the presence of support people during labour: https://www.sogc.org/en/content/featured-news/A-Joint-Statement-on-the-Issue-of-Support-Persons-in-Labour-in-Canada.aspx.\n\u2800\nFor our recommendations around adding support people to the home during the pandemic, please refer to 3:45 of our video Q+A with Dr. Doug Campbell,\u00a0\u00a0Expert Series 2 (Part 1) - Newborns and COVID-19, posted on April 10th.\n\u2800\nFinally, an important message: if you are in a relationship where you feel unsafe, please tell someone you trust. We know that the risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) is heightened during pregnancy, and that rates are rising during the current pandemic. There are resources available to support you across Canada, some of which can be found at the following link: https://www.covidwi.com/get-help. We will be providing more information about IPV and supports available in the days ahead.\n\u2800\nReference: https://www.nytimes.com/article/pregnancy-birth-partner.html\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

As long as you have an uncomplicated pregnancy, it is generally considered safe to have oral, vaginal, and anal sex. Every pregnant person has different desires around sex during pregnancy and this can change throughout the course of your pregnancy.\n\u2800\nWhen it comes to sex in pregnancy, there are a few things to avoid. You should never have vaginal sex right after anal sex as this can introduce bacteria that can potentially cause infection. Your partner should also never blow air into your vagina as the air can potentially enter a blood vessel and be harmful to your and your baby.\n\u2800\nIf you have had complications in your current or previous pregnancy, talk to your provider about whether sex is safe. Usually, avoiding sex is recommended for pregnant people who are at risk of preterm labour or who have certain conditions related to the placenta.\n\u2800\nThere is a small amount of evidence to suggest that sex close to your due date may help induce labour, but this practice is considered safe in people who have low-risk pregnancies.\n\u2800\nFinally, after a vaginal or cesarean delivery, you should avoid inserting anything in your vagina for a period of at least 6 weeks. After that, you can resume sexual activity based on your level of comfort.\n\u2800\nReference: https://www.pregnancyinfo.ca/your-pregnancy/healthy-pregnancy/sex-and-pregnancy/\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #pregnancy #maternity #birth #newborn #maternalheath #primarycare #obstetrics #coronavirus #physicaldistancing\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

Miscarriage occurs in 15-20% of pregnancies. Miscarriage is usually a very difficult and upsetting event in a person\u2019s life. It is normal to feel grief, loss, and other difficult emotions in response.\n\u2800\nThe current pandemic can cause people to feel more isolated and unsure of where to go for support or care in the event of a miscarriage. We have listed some places to seek care if you think you might be having a miscarriage and will also be sharing some these resources and more in our stories.\n\u2800\nIf you have vaginal bleeding or other symptoms of miscarriage as listed above, it is important to inform your care provider to make sure everything is ok. However, we also want to emphasize that vaginal bleeding in pregnancy is not always due to miscarriage. About \u2153 of pregnant people have some bleeding before the 20th week, and about half of those pregnancies continue without any further problems.\n\u2800\nTo those of you who have experienced or are experiencing miscarriage, we want you to know that you are seen and that there are many supports available to you. Please swipe through our post or check out our stories to see some recommended resources.\n\u2800\nImage source: https://www.clipart.email/\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #pregnancy #maternalheath #coronavirus #physicaldistancing #miscarriage #pregnancyloss #miscarriageawareness\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

Because we have early intervention options for hearing loss, it is important to identify hearing loss as soon as possible. The Ontario Infant Hearing Program (IHP) provides screening for all newborns <9 weeks of age to identify those with permanent hearing loss to support their language development.\n\u2800\nGiven the current #COVID19 pandemic, the IHP is postponing in-person hearing screening appointments until further notice. This is understandably stressful but please be reassured that the IHP continues to receive referrals from hospitals and midwives and should contact you within a week of birth. Currently, babies are being placed on a waiting list to be seen once services resume.\n\u2800\nThe risk factor screening done through blood work will continue during COVID-19 and babies who screen positive will be referred for further medical and audiological follow-up.\n\u2800\nIf you do not hear from the Infant Hearing Program within a week of discharge from the hospital, you are encouraged to call your regional program. The locations can be found at: http://www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/earlychildhood/hearing/index.aspx#locations.\n\u2800\nResidents of Toronto are encouraged to use Toronto Public Health\u2019s booking system to be contacted by a Hearing Screener in the future for information regarding next steps.

        "caption": "Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a common bacteria found in the urinary system, rectum, and vagina of approximately 15-40% of people. Typically, if you have GBS, you do not have symptoms or an infection because it is part of the normal bacteria in these areas of your body. However, if GBS is present in pregnancy, it can be passed onto the baby during birth and cause a rare but serious infection unless antibiotics are given during labour and delivery.\n\u2800\nThe presence of this bacteria can come and go. All pregnant people are usually screened for GBS between 35-37 weeks\u2019 gestation (during one of their in-person visits) to detect if the bacteria is there around the time of delivery. You may be tested earlier if you go into labour or your water breaks before 35 weeks of pregnancy. Screening involves swabbing the opening of the vagina and rectum with a cotton-tipped swab. The swab is then tested to check if GBS is present (a positive test). If GBS was found in a urine test done before 35 weeks, this is also a positive test and you do not need to be swabbed.\n\u2800\nIf you test positive for GBS, it doesn't mean that you're ill or that your baby will be affected. It simply means the potential for newborn infection exists. It is recommended that individuals who test positive receive antibiotics during labour to decrease the chance of the baby developing an infection.\n\u2800\nPlease discuss with your care provider to determine when screening for GBS would be best for you. Remember to remind your care team about your GBS status during labour.\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #pregnancy #maternity #birth #newborn #maternalhealth #primarycare #obstetrics #coronavirus #physicaldistancing\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

Today, we will be focusing on an experience that about 40-80% of people can have in pregnancy: nausea and vomiting.\n\u2800\nThese symptoms can be experienced at any time in the day or night. Nausea and vomiting usually occurs from 6 to 14 weeks\u2019 gestation, but it can last throughout pregnancy for some.\n\u2800\nThe physical and hormonal changes that your body goes through during pregnancy are thought to cause these symptoms. Mild nausea and vomiting is not harmful to you or your baby.\n\u2800\nEven though these symptoms can be a normal part of pregnancy, the discomfort can be challenging. Swipe to read helpful tips for easing the symptoms. Keep in mind that everyone and every pregnancy is different.\n\u2800\nIf these tips are not relieving your nausea, please speak to your healthcare provider. There are several anti-nausea medications that are prescribed in pregnancy.\n\u2800\nWe would love to hear what has worked for you or someone you know who experienced nausea and vomiting during pregnancy?\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #pregnancy #parentobe #maternity #maternalheath #primarycare #obstetrics #morningsickness \u2800\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

No matter the format or topic, prenatal classes aim to help you feel prepared for the upcoming months of your life. You and your birthing partner(s) can benefit from learning as much as possible about labour, delivery, and transitioning into parenthood. If this is not your first delivery, you may still find a refresher course helpful.\n\nUnfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited expecting parents\u2019 access to in-person classes. Thankfully, there are some classes that are now being offered virtually. We have included a list of publicly funded (*there may still be a fee)programs that are offering virtual prenatal classes at this time (link in bio.) We suggest to first speak to your healthcare provider directly to ask what classes may be available in your area and delivery site. Our list is not complete so if you have found a virtual prenatal class helpful, please share in the comments below.\n\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #pregnancy #parenting #maternity #birth #newborn #postpartum #maternalheath #primarycare #obstetrics #COVID19 #coronavirus #pregnancynutrition #dietandnutrition #eatinginpregnancy #prenatalclass #prenatalclasses #virtualprenatalclasses\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

It is commonly offered to patients who are approaching or already past their due date, and requires that the cervix is already partially opened (a sign that your body is getting ready for labour). A stretch and sweep may also prevent the need for a medical induction if your baby is overdue.\n\u2800\nYour care provider will discuss with you the benefits and risks of having a stretch and sweep. Done in the clinic, hospital, or home, this procedure involves the use of a gloved finger to separate the amniotic sac from the cervix during a vaginal examination. This process will cause your body to release a natural substance called prostaglandins, which help to prepare your cervix for labour. You may experience symptoms of pain during the procedure, and spotting or cramping after the procedure which are normal. However, if you experience fluid leaking or heavy bleeding (very rare), call your care provider.\n\u2800\nAlthough a stretch and sweep can increase your chances of going into labour, how soon this occurs will depend on how ready your body is for labour. If you still do not go into labour, your care provider may repeat a stretch and sweep or recommend a medical induction. They will discuss the best option for you depending on the risks and benefits for you and your baby.\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #pregnancy #parentobe #parenting #maternity #birth #newborn #postpartum #breastfeeding #maternalheath #primarycare #obstetrics #stretchandsweep\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

The long answer is that additional energy demands vary with respect to trimester, as well as personal patient factors (i.e. if you are carrying multiples). Typically, additional energy demands are negligible in the first trimester, approximately 350 kcal/day in the second trimester, and 500 kcal/day in the third trimester. An extra 350 calories may look like 2 eggs (~75 cal/egg), 1 piece of multigrain toast (~120 cal), and 1 banana (~80 cal). 500 calories may look like that, plus half of an avocado (~150-160 cal).\n\u2800\nRather than eating for TWO, try eating TWICE as healthy to provide yourself and your baby with the nutrients you both need!\n\u2800\nWhy is it important to ensure you are eating healthy amounts?

In general, your iron intake should increase to 27mg per day in the final 6 months of pregnancy. Because prenatal vitamins contain calcium and magnesium which interfere with iron absorption, most pregnant people cannot get enough iron from their prenatal vitamin alone. For these reasons, a separate iron supplement is often recommended. Please speak to your own healthcare provider to discuss what supplement would be appropriate for you. As iron deficiency in pregnancy can lead to potential problems for pregnant people and their babies, appropriate iron supplementation is important for the prevention of these potential issues.\n\u2800\nThree helpful tips to maximize your iron absorption include 1) taking your oral iron supplements with orange juice/lemon water either at bedtime OR 1-2 hours before/after coffee, tea, and calcium supplements, 2) eating foods rich in vitamin C, and 3) maintaining an iron-rich diet.\n\u2800\nSwipe to read more about the side effects that you may experience with taking oral iron supplements.

A placenta previa is when the placenta covers part or all of the cervix.\n\u2800\nLow-lying placenta and placenta previa can occur in as many as 1 out of 3 pregnancies before 20 weeks.The reassuring news: the majority of these placentas will move away from the cervix and lower uterine segment by the third trimester as the uterus grows.

In this second video of the series, we focus on pelvic pain: the different types, the causes, and great tips that can help you on your postpartum journey.\n\u2800\nPelvic pain can occur during pregnancy, and can persist in approximately 40% of people. There can also be new-onset pelvic pain in about 7% of people after childbirth. The symptoms of pelvic pain vary, ranging from cramps to pain involving the entire abdomen. There are many different causes during pregnancy and the postpartum period, including but not limited to: the growth of the fetus, stiffness of pelvic joints, tension in the pelvic floor, being overweight, and having a history of lower back and/or pelvic girdle pain. So many people suffer in silence, but there is help available. \n\u2800\nKim Vopni is a restorative exercise specialist and a certified pre/post natal fitness consultant. Kim has created extensive content, such as exercise programs and books to help everyone learn about and connect with their pelvic floor health and the changes that may come with giving birth.\n\u2800\nStay tuned for the next video of this \u2018common postpartum problems\u2019 series on prolapse with Kim Vopni!\n\u2800\nDo you have pelvic floor health questions for Kim?

It was tough\u2026 my twin girls were born premature but I managed to exclusively breastfeed with the help of an amazing lactation consultant (@sofyabrainin) and support from my partner and family.\n\u2800\nFor the first few months, I used nipple shields and I had to build up my supply to provide enough milk for two babies (I pumped after each feed for quite a while). I developed mastitis (an infection due to blocked ducts, nipple shields, oversupply, etc.) not once, but twice, and was quite sick as a result. The worst part about mastitis was that my supply plummeted and I had to rebuild my supply all over again. Despite these setbacks, I was determined to keep going.\n\u2800\nWe had such a good rhythm with breastfeeding that when I eventually wanted to introduce bottles, they wouldn\u2019t take them! So it was me, my twins, my twin breastfeeding pillow, and my breasts for several months. To maintain my supply, I was drinking TONS of water, herbs (fenugreek and blessed thistle), and was making sure my calorie intake was adequate. I absolutely LOVED breastfeeding my girls but it was also all-consuming for me.\n\u2800\nI learned to breastfeed in tandem\u2026 it was really the only way with twins, but it was tricky to do so in public, especially since you sort of need to completely undress and I always needed a breastfeeding pillow to prop them up. It was really hard when I compared myself to moms with just one baby who could just breastfeed anywhere and had a lot more freedom.\n\u2800\nI breastfed until the girls were about 15-18 months\u2026 I was sad when they eventually weaned off the breast themselves, but it also happened so organically. Once they stopped, it gave me back some freedom.\n\u2800\nAt the end of the day, I think it\u2019s important to emphasize that breastfeeding is difficult for many people. Some of my patients struggle to continue breastfeeding, some continue to exclusively pump, some have chosen not to breastfeed at all, and some may not even have the option of breastfeeding due to health reasons.\n\u2800\nBottom line: no matter what your feeding journey is, we are here to support you.\n",

No one packaging formulation is 'best' - choose a formulation that works best for you, your infant and your lifestyle.\n\u2800\n*Note: Because powdered formula is not sterile, babies under two months of age, premature babies and not yet two months past their expected due date, and babies who have a compromised immune system should only be given concentrated liquid or ready-to-feed formula.\n\u2800\nSwipe through this post to read more about which type of formula and which packaging formulation may be best for you and your infant.\n\u2800\nWe realize the decision to breastfeed or formula feed your baby is an incredibly personal one.

I knew it was going to be hard, but I didn't really understand all of the emotions and mom guilt that would come along with it.\n\u2800\nIt took several days for my milk to come in and then when it did, I was in so much pain. There were hot showers, stinky cabbage leaves, and struggling to figure out a brand new pump. This was all combined with recovering from a difficult vaginal delivery.\n\u2800\nMy first child and I really struggled with breastfeeding. We were at either the lactation consultant or the pediatrician almost every day that first month. I had friends using herbal supplements, but I knew if I was going to succeed, I needed to pull out the big guns so I went right to the maximum dose of domperidone when Jack was only a few days old. I was so exhausted that when people talked to me about trying tube feeding, I knew I wouldn't be able to make it work and that would throw me over the breastfeeding ledge. As a result, I started cup feeding formula to top him off after breastfeeding.\n\u2800\nIt took me the full month for Jack to get back to his birth weight. I remember when the pediatrician told me I didn't have to come back for a month, I asked her what I would do with myself. She told me to \"find some friends\". I continued to breastfeed for 4.5 months, at which point I was going back to work and knew I wouldn't have the time or flexibility to pump so I switched over to formula. I kept up with the domperidone until I weaned because I was so afraid to come off and struggle again.\n\u2800\nAt the end of the day, I think it\u2019s important to emphasize that breastfeeding is difficult for many people. Some of my patients struggle to continue breastfeeding, some continue to exclusively pump, some have chosen not to breastfeed at all, and some may not even have the option of breastfeeding due to health reasons.\n\u2800\nBottom line: no matter what your feeding journey is, we are here to support you.\n\u2800\n",

Her little weight on my chest was incredibly humbling and when she was first put on my breast, my feeding worries melted away...for a moment. Through our hospital stay, despite the support of our kind nurses, I was unable to produce anything and when her blood sugar dropped, we decided to give her some formula. This is the first time I felt shame that my body was unable to produce what she needed. I felt this a lot in her first year. Despite visits to lactation clinics, herbs and breastfeeding cookies (lots of cookies), my supply was never enough to meet her needs so we did a combo of formula+pumped milk. I felt an internal pressure for her to have breastmilk, so I would pump several times a day. I remember crying over an oz. of pumped milk that was left out and discarded because it had taken so much effort to make. Even if it was just an oz. here and there, it felt like it qualified me to be her mom.\n\u2800\nAfter months of pumping, it was Layla's doctor who saw the effect it was having on my mental health. She saw what I couldn't see myself, in the form of postpartum anxiety. The time spent pumping and sleep loss was taking a toll and she gave me what I could not give myself, permission to stop. At 8 months, we transitioned Layla onto formula. With Myles, my milk came in more easily but when my mental health started to shift, I decided to stop pumping at 5 months and transitioned him fully to formula.\n\u2800\nIn retrospect, the amount of breastmilk our kids were receiving was very little. Both of our beautiful and healthy kids, now 3 and 9 months are doing awesome and I now see that the time spent away from them to pump could have been spent being with them (or sleeping). When you're in the thick of it though, it's hard to see clearly when obscured by guilt.\n\u2800\nParents face a lot of external (and internal) pressure for every decision we make. This is hard stuff. Let's support each other with kindness, especially during this pandemic when things are more difficult.\n\u2800\nSending love to all of you whatever your feeding journey is.

You don\u2019t want to miss this segment - Kim uses some great visual aids to help describe the different types of prolapse.\n\u2800\nPelvic organ prolapse (POP) occurs when organs, such as the bladder and uterus, descend from their anatomical position and push against or out of the walls of the vagina. It is possible for more than one organ to prolapse. POP occurs due to weakened and/or stretched pelvic floor muscles that normally hold your pelvic organs in place.\n\u2800\nPOP can occur immediately after childbirth or over time. Risk factors for prolapse include, but are not limited to: family history of prolapse, smoking history, connective tissue disease, operative vaginal delivery using vacuum or forceps, and increased pressure in your belly such as frequent constipation or obesity. Although POP is strongly associated with vaginal deliveries, having a Cesarean delivery without labour does not fully protect against the incidence of POP. Up to half of previously pregnant individuals have some degree of clinical POP, of which approximately 10-20% are symptomatic.\n\u2800\nThere are many different symptoms of POP depending on the severity, including but not limited to: pressure in the lower belly, something falling out of your vagina, and/or pain during intercourse. Many people may not be aware of their POP if it is asymptomatic or if the symptoms are transient. However, as Kim explains, it is important to get screened before returning to exercise due to the potential risk of worsening the POP. The good news: there is help available and it can get better over time and with the exercises Kim suggests.\n\u2800\nKim Vopni is a restorative exercise specialist and a certified pre/post natal fitness consultant. Kim has created extensive content, such as exercise programs and books to help everyone learn about and connect with their pelvic floor health and the changes that may come with giving birth.\n\u2800\nDisclaimer in comments below...\n",

Below are the Canadian guidelines for the recommended DEET concentrations per age group:\n- 30% for adults and children older than 12 years old\n- 10% for children ages 2 to 12 years old, and can be applied 3 times maximum daily\n- 10% for children aged 6 months to 2 years old, and should not be applied more than once a day\n- Do not use a DEET containing repellent on children younger than 6 months\n\u2800\nBottom line: when protecting against both sun and insects, try to stay in the shade and use clothing as additional protective methods. Finally, remember to put on sunscreen first, and bug spray second.\n\u2800\nDr. Carroll is a board certified dermatologist practicing in Toronto at Compass Dermatology.

This video is targeted toward pregnant teachers who are returning to work and what this means given the COVID-19 pandemic. In this interview, Dr. Eli Shore provides evidence-based information and reassurance surrounding this topic. \n\nKey takeaways:\n1. COVID-19 case numbers in Ontario are currently low and have been low for quite some time, suggesting that there is limited community transmission.\n2. If a pregnant individual gets COVID-19, there are currently no known implications for the fetus.\n3. While masks/sanitizing may be unfamiliar in the school setting, there are many pregnant healthcare professionals who regularly wear masks and sanitize even prior to COVID-19, and there are no adverse effects of this on the pregnancy.\n4. The most important thing is to ensure that we all have access the appropriate personal protective equipment and that we practice proper mask etiquette and hand hygiene.\n5. Public Health Ontario recently released guidelines for individuals who are at high risk of COVID-19. At this time healthy, low-risk pregnant individuals are not included on this list and therefore are not indicated to be off work related the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition, please remember that COVID-19 evidence is constantly changing; therefore, while information shared in this video is relevant today, this video may no longer reflect the most up-to-date findings as time goes on.

Some family doctors have special training in obstetrics (FMOB) and can therefore follow you throughout your pregnancy, deliver your baby, and follow you and your baby after. Alternatively, some people choose to have their pregnancy, labour/delivery, and postpartum care followed by a midwife. Depending on the clinic, you can self refer to any of these providers once you find out you are pregnant, or you can ask your primary care provider for a referral to the provider of your choosing.\n\u2800\nSo, how are they different?

She discusses techniques such as grounding, ways to slow down, navigating social media, and connecting to laughter and silliness in these times. Lindsay also discusses the importance of compassion and self-compassion when it comes to anxiety surrounding pandemic parenting.\n\u2800\nLindsay reminds us that if you are reading this or listening to this, you ARE coping, adjusting, and helping your family system navigate these challenging times.\n\u2800\nFinally, Lindsay recommends the following experts: Tara Brach @tarabrach, Dennis Tirch @drdennistirch, Esther Perel @estherperelofficial, Nedra Tawwab @nedratawwab, and Lynn Lyons @flusterclux.

When the baby \u201cinhales\u201d in the womb, the amniotic fluid that enters their lungs will cause their diaphragm to contract, resulting in hiccups.\n\u2800\nEvery pregnant individual will start to feel baby hiccups at a different time, and some may not experience them at all. In general, however, most pregnant individuals will begin to feel baby hiccups by the start of the third trimester.\n\u2800\nBaby hiccups may feel like a pulsing or rhythmic twitching from one area of your belly, and can last anywhere from a minute to an hour. Some pregnant individuals experience them rarely, while they may occur several times a day for others.\n\u2800\nBaby kicks may feel like movement coming from different parts of your belly, and may stop if you reposition yourself. They can occur when the baby is adjusting their position, or when their senses are stimulated after you eat something cold, hot, or sweet.\n\u2800\nTypically, baby hiccups are a normal reflex. However, you should contact your care provider if you have concerns.\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #pregnancy #maternity #birth #newborn #postpartum #primarycare #obstetrics #babyhiccups #fetalmovement\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

This song has now been translated in 28 languages and has become an important tool around the world in helping children wash their hands.\u2800\n\u2800\nThe lyrics to the song are as follows (to the tune of Fre\u0300re Jacques):\u2800\n\u2800\n\u201cScrub your palms, between the fingers, wash the back, wash the back, twirl the tips around, scrub them upside down, thumb attack, thumb attack.\u201d\u2800\n\u2800\nWatch Lekha\u2019s step-by-step demonstration at 3:55 and jump straight to the song at 5:00.\u2800\n\u2800\nThis handwashing song and its 28 translated versions can be found at this link: https://cleanhandssavelives.org/hand-washing-song/\u2800\n\u2800\nWe hope you enjoyed this expert series and we encourage you to sing this song with your child to help make handwashing fun and easy to remember!\u2800\n\u2800\n#pandemicpregnancy #pushingthroughthepandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #obstetrics #primarycare #coronavirus #COVID19 #backtoschool #pediatrics #pandemicparenting #handhygiene #handwashing #backtoschool2020\u2800\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

Recently, physicians have begun re-starting this important screening practice and it is important that you get an updated pap test if your last one was more than 3 years ago.\n\u2800\nFor those who have had an abnormal pap smear or those who have not started screening yet, there have been changes made to the Ontario screening recommendations:\n\u2800\n1) If you\u2019ve had an abnormal pap smear in the last 6 months to 1 year, your physician may recommend that you get a repeat test done in 1 year instead of 6 months. This applies to those whose previous pap smear showed ASCUS (atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance) or LSIL (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion).\n\u2800\n2) If you have not yet started screening, the guidelines are changing to recommend screening starting at age 25 instead of 21. Please see the slide at the end of the video for more information regarding this change.\n\u2800\nDoctors are also trying to take advantage of opportunistic screening during this pandemic. If you are visiting your doctor for an unrelated health reason, your visit may be a good opportunity for your doctor to also add in a pap smear instead of doing this in a separate visit.\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #newborn #postpartum #primarycare #obstetrics #coronavirus #COVID19 #cervicalcancer #cervicalcancerscreening #papsmear #paptest\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

And if so, for how long?\n\u2800\nOfficial statements differ in their suggestions on whether pregnancy should be delayed (and for how long) after vaccination.\n\u2800\nHealth Canada\u2019s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends waiting 28 days after receiving the complete vaccination series before trying to conceive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), on the contrary, mentions no advice to avoid pregnancy after COVID-19 vaccination\n\u2800\nIt should be noted that during the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine trials, 23 women (12 in the vaccine arm and 11 in the placebo arm) became pregnant following vaccination and are being followed for pregnancy outcomes with no reports of adverse effects to date.\n\u2800\nBottomline: currently there is no data indicating that pregnancy should be delayed after receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. Given the lack of data at the moment, NACI has recommended delaying trying to conceive by 28 days. We suggest speaking with your primary care and/or obstetrical care provider until further data is available.\n\u2800\nReferences:\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/national-advisory-committee-on-immunization-naci/recommendations-use-covid-19-vaccines.html\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html\nhttps://sogc.org/common/Uploaded%20files/Latest%20News/SOGC_Statement_COVID-19_Vaccination_in_Pregnancy.pdf\n\u2800\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #pregnancy #maternity #maternalheath #primarycare #obstetrics #coronavirus #COVID19 #COVID19vaccine #fda #cdc #sogc\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

I was so nervous because I knew that once it was go time I could be alone for hours waiting until my husband could actually join me to help support me through. I had spent the majority of my pregnancy appointments, scans and tests going it alone. My husband was deprived of all of those experiences and I felt like I was missing my partner and participating in our baby growing without him being able to be involved like he wanted to be. At 3 am on October 1st I threw up and I heard my husband in the nursery gathering our things - he walked past the bathroom and said \u201cthat\u2019s enough. You\u2019re going to the hospital\u201d. I put off going as long as I could. I ended up labouring for another 3 hours alone in triage until they would admit me and allow my husband to come up and join me. I didn\u2019t ever imagine that being masked and isolated would be a part of my birth.\n\u2800\nIn the end everything went to plan and our baby girl Rogue was born that evening at 7:27 pm.

Being a first time mom, first pregnancy during a pandemic and lockdowns has not been easy, but having this account to get information has been extremely helpful.\n\u2800\nI want to share my story, partially for awareness, but mostly for my own healing from the trauma.\n\u2800\nI found out I was pregnant at the end of January 2020, and while I had lots of nausea, \"morning\" sickness and food aversions to everything (I even lost weight in the first trimester), it seemed like I was having a normal, low risk pregnancy...or so I was told. When lockdown started in March 2020 it came at a great time because I started working from home, which looking back I think is what greatly helped me being able to carry my baby full term.\n\nFast forward to the third trimester, I was having terrible headaches that never went away, started getting pain in my upper right side, radiating all across my upper back and my upper left side, I also started having nausea and vomiting again. I was always thorough and told my OB in detail all my pains and aches, but was dismissed as \"normal pregnancy.\" I even asked if there would be a blood test (my last blood test was at 20 weeks) or a urine sample, but was told no because my blood pressure was low and the baby seemed fine.\n\u2800\nOn October 7 I had an OB appointment and I was not good, I even said to my OB \"I don't know how anyone ever has more than one kid because this is so hard.\" Looking back, I was having all the HELLP syndrome symptoms. But I was told I was fine and to go to triage if I feel off. Not even 12 hours later, at 3am, I told my husband we needed to go to the hospital.\n\u2800\nI had been vomiting all night, didn't even have anything else in me, my body pains were more intense and I was cutting in and out. My husband didn't quite understand why we had to go and was trying to go back to sleep, as this was not signs of early labour like we had learned from the prenatal classes.\n\u2800\nWe went to the hospital around 3:30am--luckily it's only a 10min drive away but I'm pretty sure I passed out twice.\n",

I first want to say I am so grateful for all the health care workers who have had to make many sacrifices throughout this year, and that my comments are in regards to the health care system not the people. Note this is also coming from a person who struggles with anxiety and at times depression.\n\nStarting with my pregnancy, which began basically at the start of the pandemic in Canada, it felt fairly manageable. I did have some phases where I struggled with depression in that period, which were further exacerbated by the fact I wasn't allowed to have my husband with me for any appointments - mostly bummed he couldn't be apart of the ultrasounds and that I didn't get to share those things with him in the moment. Instead it was in the car afterwards showing him pictures we had to pay for so he could be at least somewhat apart of the pregnancy and experience a portion of what he should have been able to had there not been pandemic restrictions.\n\nFast forward to labour and delivery. The staff at the hospital were fantastic. For me, it hardly felt like we were in a pandemic besides the fact that we had to wear masks. I felt like our quality of care was not diminished in the slightest by the pandemic. My husband got to be apart of almost all phases of labour, just not the initial assessment, so that helped immensely.\n\nThings have been the most upsetting more recently post delivery/during my postpartum period.\n\nBeing a first time mom comes with its stressors and anxieties even when there isn't a pandemic. Added to that I've been struggling with postpartum depression and anxiety. Our daughter has had a few medical concerns that have required her to have an increased number of visits to our family doctor, one trip to emergency and one trip to the children's hospital for an appointment. All of this I was forced to take on by basically myself, with my husband patiently waiting in the car for us.\n",

        "caption": "Continuing our sharing of stories of resilience in honour of IWD\u2026\n\n\u201cNavigating pregnancy during a pandemic is petrifying. As a first time mom, I was already nervous - I was also working as a nurse which added to the stress. My pregnancy was unusual, and scary. But here I am snuggling my beautiful one month old son, so incredibly thankful. I felt so isolated , it seems like no one talks about the \u2018ugly\u2019 side of pregnancy.\n\nAt 24 weeks along I found out, alone, that my baby had a velamentous cord. I went to hospital in pain, and found out things might get complicated for us going forward. I was so scared for my baby. At 31 +3, our son decided he wanted to try to meet us. I wasn\u2019t feeling right, and went into hospital begrudgingly -called myself a wimp even. Thankfully the (amazing) team at my local hospital recognized the preterm labour and sent me to another hospital that could manage this. Things got really intense , but thankfully they were able to stop labour long enough for steroids to work in case he decided to arrive again.\n\nI was hospitalized for 8 days. With the current covid situation at that time, the visitor policy had changed, and I can honestly say this was the hardest week of my life. I was restricted to not even being able to see my husband, because when he came he wasn\u2019t allowed to leave, and we had no idea what the next days/weeks may or may not bring.\n\nMy take away though, is to remain positive in this very humbling time being a patient and not the nurse.\n\nFor the moms, moms to be, anxious moms, NICU moms, high risk moms- all off us. (and all the dads that I am sure feel helpless in these times). I have learned quickly that these babes make us stronger, but it\u2019s still okay to feel all the emotions. What matters is recognizing that this happens, and should be talked about. Feeling like there is no where to reach out to talk makes things harder. Thankfully I have amazing support, and I knew things would be okay.\n\nI was discharged from hospital, and managed to carry to 39 weeks! We had a healthy baby boy, and feel so lucky.\n",

My husband & I had to prepare for a baby with 40% less household income. I always wanted to go back to school, so since I had more time on my hands I took the opportunity to start taking courses to better myself in the business world. It was a very hard emotional time due to hormones, and even the unexpected realization that I was grieving a job and a lifestyle that I enjoyed. I hired a lawyer and am in the process of suing the company because I don't go down without a fight. I had my baby in Jan 2021. I had to get induced as I was having trouble dilating because the baby was facing sunny side up. I got a cervidil inserted for 24 hours, got sent home and went back. Only 1/2cm. Then a Foley inserted for another 24hrs. Got sent home and went back yet again. (I can't even count all the cervical assessments I got).\n\u2800\nAfter 12 hours of labor and having my water broken, the doctor said since baby is still happy in there we should consider a c-section because it's better to go about it now, then wait for an emergency because the longer we wait the riskier it can get. (as my water had been broken for quite some time). I've never had surgery before, let alone an unexpected one! So I was very nervous. Finally the moment arrived when my baby was born. My husband & I couldn't have been happier!!! 2 days later we were discharged. My parents came over to meet the baby. Also, during this time my grandmother was at the same hospital I was, but on a different floor due to a flare-up of a heart condition she has. My grandmother ended up testing positive for COVID during her stay at the hospital. Then my mom tested positive for COVID (but no symptoms). So no one was able to help us out with the baby for the first couple of weeks.\n\u2800\nToronto Public Health sent my mom a letter and later phoned her as well to say if she had no symptoms after 1 week she didn't have to stay in quarantine. That was the most anxious week of my life. But she felt great the whole time!\n",

My birth went well and baby and I are both super healthy and I\u2019m so so happy for you. But my postpartum mental health has been rocky to say the least. It\u2019s been a roller coaster. Lots of crying lots of postpartum anxiety. I have good days and bad days. It took me time to get help, but I\u2019m now working on it! I\u2019m part of a great program at women\u2019s college hospital that supports women, and in my case postpartum mental health support. So far it\u2019s been very helpful and I\u2019m optimistic things will improve. I\u2019ve learned nothing is linear postpartum, so I\u2019m not expecting a perfect picture moving forward. I\u2019m hopeful that I\u2019ll build some solid mama tools to help my mental health.\n\u2800\nI do wish that we spoke more openly about postpartum mental health. The more I open up to my mom friends the more tell me how they also struggled either with depression or anxiety.\n\u2800\nI hope that through your sharing of stories you can share many about the trials and tribulations of postpartum depression and anxiety. A lot of social media depicts the first year of babies life as perfect. And what I\u2019m learning from my own experiences and from my mom friends is it\u2019s nothing close to that. It\u2019s a magical experience. It\u2019s amazing seeing this little human you birthed grow and thrive.

As we approach the one year anniversary of our loss, I have such mixed feelings towards what has happened.

I had been working as a nurse at CAMH until May, when I started my maternity leave. Going from seeing my co-workers everyday to seeing no one was quite challenging. But I think I naively hoped it wouldn't last too long. My son was born at home and what started out as a blissful newborn stage, quickly turned into anger, sadness, and resentment. I was in pain, I was sore, I was lonely and I felt this baby was completely to blame. My mother had died November 2017 and I wished I could have her with me to help or just give me words of encouragement and I knew I'd never get that from her again. My anxiety about my baby came and went and came and went. I had wonderful days where I'd look at my family and think how lucky and perfect everything was and days where I'd wish it would all end. My husband was amazing and supportive and did more than I could have ever have asked or hoped for, but ultimately it was my body that constantly needed. It was my body that had transformed and was now unrecognizable. I almost enjoyed lockdown so I wouldn't have to see anyone looking how I did. As my baby got older, I reached a breaking point where I finally reached out to my sisters and I'm so happy I did that. Being a mother or new mother in quarantine or lockdown is hard. Luckily, I've been feeling so much better and have been actually able to enjoy my kids more and more. These are times that I wish I could be sharing with my sisters, my friends, my in-laws and they are forced to watch this stage of my children's lives through video and pictures.\n\nI will always cherish these moments that we as a family have been able to have together, but I will always wonder what amazing memories we never got to experience.\u201d\n\n-Camellia, @camelliamohebat\n",

So with everything settling down in the summer, we decided to simply start trying a couple months ahead of schedule. Well, we got pregnant very quickly and were over the moon about it. Then, at a last minute ultrasound booked due to some unexplained spotting, we discovered that our baby had a Cystic Hygroma. We were devastated, especially when told the odds for our baby's survival and quality of life. We were given the option of terminating or doing genetic testing to try and determine the cause, and we took the later option. What followed were months of quiet tears, stress, secret appointments and desperately trying to stay positive while only keeping a chosen few in the loop. I hid my pregnancy from friends and some family, and couldn't bring myself to feel happy about it.I dreaded growing attached in case things went wrong, and this was all while trying to continue working as teachers in a pandemic. Work was stressful, appointments took their toll, and things were a struggle.\u2800\n\u200b\u2800\nFinally, after weeks/months of tests, we were told the Hygroma was shrinking, and that everything had come back negative, but that they had also discovered that we had a single umbilical artery. It felt like we had finally received the good news only to be thrown one more curveball. So now we monitored for growth. There was no way to hide the pregnancy any more, and I was growing attached as I felt kicks, hiccups, and rolls. I knew this baby was ours and I was finally willing to share with friends and family. We continued to be monitored and checked and things were progressing beautifully. The Hygroma was almost entirely gone and our baby was as healthy as could be!\u2800\n",

All was great until I got pregnant in the fall and found out just before Christmas! I had so many emotions, I was so excited as I have endometriosis and we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d get pregnant so fast or if at all and I had just recently come off my oral treatment for endometriosis. The excitement then turned to fear; this could be my only pregnancy, what if I get covid-19, is it safe for both of us to get vaccinated etc. I\u2019d have panic attacks before work and not sleep (not ideal before a 12hr busy shift) as I was so anxious. I leaned on my support of people and my manager assured me I wouldn\u2019t be exposed to a potential positive patient or confirmed positive patients. I was re-fitted for my N95 and set to go. Recently I received my first Covid-19 vaccine at 20 weeks 6 days gestation. I\u2019m proud to say I work on the only inpatient floor in my hospital not to have a covid-19 outbreak and I miss my team so much they\u2019re honestly amazing!\n\u2800\nAmazing men and women! So supportive of one another and so caring for our patients and each other. Working while pregnant is terrifying but also I\u2019m grateful that my vocation has allowed me to work through all of this mess, granted with more stress than usual, but it could be much worse.\u201d\n",

While the majority of pregnant individuals infected with COVID-19 still have mild to moderate symptoms, numerous studies are also showing that COVID-19 is associated with adverse complications for the mother and baby, including preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, lower birth weight, ICU admission for the pregnant individual, and NICU admission for the baby. Previously, pregnant individuals were placed in the \u201cat risk\u201d category in the vaccination plan. But pregnant individuals are now considered not just \u201cat risk,\u201d they considered in the highest risk category for COVID-19 infection.\n\u2800\nThanks to the advocacy of Drs. @talibogler, Isaac Bogoch, and many others, pregnant individuals are being moved higher in the prioritization for COVID-19 vaccination.\n\u2800\nHow do you feel about this update?

The side effects were similar in pregnant vs. non pregnant individuals. There were small differences: injection site pain was more common in pregnant persons, but systemic side effects like fever and headaches were more common in non-pregnant persons.\n\u2800\n2. Although not directly comparable, the proportion of adverse pregnancy & neonatal outcomes among the participants who completed pregnancies (i.e. delivered) in the v-safe registry were similar to published incidences in pregnant population studies just before the pandemic.\n\u2800\n3. Out of the participants who had a live birth, 98.3% of participants received their first dose in the 3rd trimester. We do not have enough data on first trimester vaccination from this cohort yet!\n\u2800\nBottom line: these early findings did not show obvious safety issues with respect to pregnancy or neonatal outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination in the third trimester of pregnancy. More data is needed to assess outcomes associated with COVID-19 vaccination in the earlier stages of pregnancy.\n\u2800\nTo read the full article, visit this webpage: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983#.YIGGenKyhrw.twitter\n\u2800\n#pandemicpregnancy #pushingthroughthepandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #pregnancy #maternalheath #birth #obstetrics #research #cdc #covid19 #coronavirus #evidencebased #evidencebasedplatform #vaccine #vaccinesafety #mRNA #pfizer #moderna\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

We welcome you to continue to DM us your stories.\n\u2800\n1/ \u201cMy husband and I started trying for our first baby in April 2019. We finally had success and I got my first positive pregnancy test in December 2019, unfortunately just a week later I miscarried over Christmas. I felt so broken and alone. We kept trying after that using it as a positive sign to keep going.\n\u2800\nWhen the pandemic hit, I remember questioning if we should still try, is it safe for me and the baby? After our miscarriage there truly wasn't any stopping us, of course we would still try. We had gotten so close already.\n\u2800\nExactly a year later we got pregnancy. April 2020. We were so naively confident that by January 2021 when our baby was due that the pandemic surely had to be over. Little did we know then that we'd be giving birth in a second wave and a second provincial wide lock down.\n\u2800\nThe pregnancy was totally normal and healthy. Over the months I truly loved being at home sharing my bump when we could. Overall, I was able to remain positive. After the miscarriage, It was hard to celebrate the pregnancy for a while, it was hard to be excited with people because all I could say was \"it's still early, anything could happen\u201d\n\u2800\nI was so scared of losing the baby. At 16 weeks I had a kidney stone for the first time and rushed to the ER thinking that was it.\n\u2800\n",

It is\u00a0 important to note that perinatal mood disorders impact BIPOC mothers and LGBTQ2S+ birthing parents at higher rates.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPlease know that if you or someone you know is struggling, it\u2019s ok to be not be ok.\u00a0 Mental health concerns often go untreated as it can be difficult to reach out for support because the symptoms can be dismissed, it may not be clear where to ask for help and despite it being so common, there remains significant stigma related to it.\u00a0 By openly discussing mental health concerns, we can raise awareness and help us all feel less alone in these struggles.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMotherhood and parenthood are no small feat and they can carry emotional, physical and mental weight that has been magnified during the pandemic.\u00a0 We at PPG are here to support you and help you access the resources you need.\u00a0\n\nDo you have any resources you have found helpful and want to share with others?

These menstrual changes are short term (i.e. for the 1-2 cycles immediately post vaccination) and do not last. There is also no relationship with possible short-term menstrual changes post vaccination and future infertility. However, if you do experience changes in your menstrual cycle after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine it is important to tell your doctor.\n\u2800\n\u201cIt\u2019s somewhat infuriating, I believe, when I feel like I can\u2019t counsel my patients \u2014 women who are menstruating,\u2014 on the full spectrum of potential side effects that could impact them. \u2026 I don\u2019t want my patients surprised if they have spotting, or earlier bleeding, or heavier menses.\u201d\n\u2800\n\u201cBut Bogler said this gap in research is not shocking. In fact, it consistently presents itself in numerous issues that affect women \u2014 like how pregnant individuals were left out of the COVID-19 initial vaccine trials.\u201d\n\u2800\n\u201cI think [this] really highlights how there are inequities in the way we study vaccines, study treatments, and deliver our treatments to our populations,\u201d she said.\u201d\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

As well, antibody transfer is greater in pregnancy vs. breast milk, which is why we recommend the whooping cough vaccine during pregnancy and not after delivery.\n\u2800\nWe also want to acknowledge that breastfeeding is not always easy and for many mothers there are significant barriers to breastfeeding. Additionally, relactation is a challenging process and may only yield a small volume of milk.\n\u2800\nFinally, we\u2019ve also had questions about milk sharing from a COVID-19 vaccinated individual. It is important to note that there are risks to sharing unpasteurized breast milk and the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends against this. If you are considering milk sharing, please speak with your healthcare provider.\n\u2800\nBottom line:\nMany studies have shown that antibodies from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines CAN pass through breast milk! Right now there is little evidence to recommend prolonging breastfeeding/pumping for older children etc. because most immunity to baby is from antibodies transferred via the placenta during pregnancy rather than breast milk. It is also unknown IF and HOW these antibodies in breast milk actually protect the baby from COVID-19. At this time, the best protection for your baby is to consider getting vaccinated during pregnancy and to encourage those around you to get vaccinated.\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

So for #medicalmonday we are sharing a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, which provides evidence that the mRNA vaccine itself does NOT cross the placenta. Only antibodies for protection against COVID-19 infection cross the placenta.\n\nThe vaccine was shown to induce a strong immune response in pregnant women and effective transfer of IgG antibodies across the placenta, potentially providing significant protection to the newborn against COVID-19 infection as early as TWO WEEKS after the FIRST vaccine dose. This also helps answer the other very common question around whether any protection from the mom can be transferred after only one dose of the vaccine.\n\nWhat about potential transfer of the vaccine in breast milk? In another pre-print study (not yet peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal), the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were NOT detected in breast milk samples 4-48 hours post-vaccination. This study provides evidence that COVID-19 mRNA vaccine itself does not transfer into breast milk and further strengthens the recommendation that breastfeeding individuals who receive a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine should continue to breastfeed their babies uninterrupted (i.e. no need to \u201cpump and dump\u201d\u009d or change your breastfeeding routine).\n\nThe studies can be found here: https://dm5migu4zj3pb.cloudfront.net/manuscripts/150000/150319/cache/150319.1-20210520093620-covered-e0fd13ba177f913fd3156f593ead4cfd.pdf\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.05.21252998v1.full.pdf\n\n#PandemicPregnancy#PushingThroughThePandemic #pregnancy #maternalheath#obstetrics #gynecology#womenshealth\n\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

When examining the placentas of those who were vaccinated vs. not, there was NO increase in placental abnormalities or placental injury.\n\u2800\nWhy is it important for us to look at the placenta?\n \n1. Placentas are like the \u201cblack box\u201d of pregnancies. When somethings goes wrong in the pregnancy, we often see changes in the placenta. \n \n2. There was a vaccine myth/theory floating around the internet several months ago claiming that the spike protein on COVID-19 (also encoded for by the COVID-19 vaccine) shares genetic similarities to syncytin-1 (an important protein for placental development). The claim went on to say that if our antibodies attack the spike protein, perhaps they can also attack syncytin-1 and damage the placenta. See our video with @alex.dainis from back in January that reviews why this theory is not biologically plausible, as the genetic sequence similarity between the two proteins is only 3% (which is essentially nothing in the genetics world). This most recent study is just further proof that the COVID-19 vaccine does not affect the placenta.\n \n3. There ARE some studies showing that COVID-19 infection itself can cause concerning changes to the placenta\n\u2800\nThe bottom line of this study is that COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy is associated with a very good antibody response without placental injury. This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting COVID-19 vaccination is safe in pregnancy.\n\u2800\nTo read the full article, visit: https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/9900/severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2.206.aspx\n\u2800\n",

A new study conducted by The Ottawa Hospital has revealed that nearly 25% of 216 respondents experienced forms of abusive behaviour, such as having their whereabouts controlled or contact with friends and family limited, during the perinatal period. Of note, there were few cases of physical and sexual assault reported in this study. Studies conducted before the pandemic estimated that approximately 3-9% of people experienced intimate partner violence during their perinatal period. \n\nAuthors @darine5, @drmarkcwalker, @kmuldoon and colleagues at The Ottawa Hospital (@ottawahospital), found those with a household income less than $119,400 per year are 3x times more likely to encounter IPV. During health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, stress and loss of income are among many factors that can exacerbate the risk of violence. \n\nIntimate partner violence occurs in ALL settings and among ALL socioeconomic, religious, and cultural groups. During pregnancy, intimate partner violence has been associated with complications including preterm birth, miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight infants, and newborn injury or death. It is essential for our society to recognize the prevalence and impact of IPV, work to prevent IPV, and offer support to help people survive and escape violent situations. \n\nWe are hoping to add awareness to the prevalence and impact of intimate partner violence, which has increased during the pandemic. We are aware that this post may be upsetting to read. If you are in crisis and in need of support, please reach out for help. The Assaulted Women\u2019s Helpline offers a 24/7 crisis line to support women who have experienced abuse, which can be accessed toll-free at 1-866-863-0511.\n\nWe have provided a list of resources you can access if you, or someone you know, is impacted by IPV. We will also share these resources to our stories, in case you do not wish to read through the post.\n",

Most of these myths/theories (which have since been debunked) focused on women\u2019s fertility. This is not new, as many anti-vaxx groups have used fear mongering around women\u2019s future fertility with other vaccines in the past. But what about men\u2019s health? What about studies pertaining to the COVID-19 vaccine and male fertility? And what is the research on COVID-19 infection itself on men\u2019s health and future fertility?\n\u2800\nSo today, we\u2019re sharing a recent study published on June 17, 2021 that investigated sperm before and after COVID-19 vaccination, including semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and total motile sperm count, as well as evidence about COVID-19 infection and erectile dysfunction.\n\u2800\nWhat is the bottom line?!\n\u2800\nDespite circulating concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine and male infertility, there is NO evidence indicating that sperm parameters are affected by the vaccine. On the contrary, COVID-19 infection itself has been linked to a nearly 6x increased risk of developing erectile dysfunction. #gettheshottokeepithot\n\u2800\nTo read the full studies cited here: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781360?guestAccessKey=17114e03-640c-4688-b1c2-9ed8b936c3cd&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=061721\n\u2800\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/andr.13003\n\u2800\n",

In terms of Pfizer and Moderna: 1) both of their mRNA sequences code for the same full length of the spike protein 2) their lipid envelopes are different, however, this can actually be a good thing and help boost the immune response 3) finally, we use vaccines interchangeably for so many other diseases like Tetanus and Hepatitis.\n\u2800\nBottom line: According to NACI, Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines are considered interchangeable and should be used to complete your vaccination series if the same product is not available.\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

This study, done in Australia, showed that integration of telehealth in prenatal care did NOT compromise pregnancy outcomes.\n\nAnother study, published in @jamanetwork and conducted in Texas, also showed there was NO difference in the frequency of adverse perinatal outcomes between individuals who had a blend of in-person and audio virtual prenatal visits. Importantly, the majority of participants in this study were from low-income communities and found that implementation of virtual visits was associated with a greater attendance rate of prenatal visits.\n\nBottom line: Studies so far have shown that prenatal care models incorporating virtual care are safe, effective, and not associated with changes in perinatal outcomes. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, models that incorporate virtual pregnancy care may be beneficial for those who face barriers to accessing care in person.\n\nAs we begin to enter the recovery phase of the pandemic\u2026\n-What has been your experience with virtual prenatal care this past year?\n-Are there elements you hope will stay the same or change?\n-Are you hoping to continue a combination of in-person and virtual prenatal care post-pandemic?\n\nShare your experiences with us in the comments below.\n\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

Although COVID-19 vaccination safety has already been shown in US studies, this is the first Canadian data. It is important to note that this report is based on preliminary data and BORN Ontario will be conducting formal studies over time as more data becomes available. We will continue to share their data as it becomes available to us. \n\u2800\nBetween December 14, 2020 and May 31, 2021, 30,892 pregnant persons received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy. Specifically, 25,012 (81.0%) received the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine, 5,661 (18.3%) received the Moderna mRNA vaccine, 103 (0.3%) received a viral-vector vaccine (i.e., AstraZeneca or COVISHIELD), and 116 (0.4%) had missing information on type of vaccine received.\u2800\n\nTo answer the questions ppl have sent:\n\u27a1\ufe0f these are preliminary findings for period between December 2020-May 2021\n\u27a1\ufe0f129,000 pregnant ppl in ON during that time period, 1/4 received at least 1 vaxx & most were given in April 2021 (when pregnant ppl were prioritized)\n\u27a1\ufe0fOn average, pregnant individuals received the vaccine around 25 weeks gestation\n\u27a1\ufe0fAs of May 31, 2021, 85% of the vaccinated pregnant women still had not given birth yet (future reports will be able to report on their pregnancy and birth outcomes)\n\u27a1\ufe0famong those vaccinated who had already given birth, there was no increased risk for poor pregnancy or birth outcomes\n\u2800\nThe bottom line of this study is that the cumulative rates of pregnancy and risk for stillbirth, preterm labour, or small babies among vaccinated pregnant persons did not differ from the background rates and birth outcomes in Ontario.\u2800\n\u2800\nIn addition, an article published today in JAMA demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at reducing the rate of infection in pregnancy. \nLink to article: \nhttps://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782047?guestAccessKey=119e3c9e-dcab-42ff-95ce-e9fb7ff5e1c9&utm_source=silverchair&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&utm_content=olf&utm_term=071221.\u2800\n\u2800\n",

It can occur in patients with pre-existing high blood pressure and it is often associated with protein in your urine. High blood pressure can result in serious complications for both the mother and the baby, to organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and eyes. Some symptoms of preeclampsia include headache, visual changes and abdominal pain. For details about signs and symptoms of preeclampsia, please visit our post on gestational hypertension.\u00a0\n\nThere is no cure for preeclampsia other than delivery. Therefore, prevention is key. This is where low dose aspirin comes in. Taking a low dose aspirin does not take away your chances of developing preeclampsia. However, multiple studies have shown it does DECREASE your risk of developing preeclampsia, with no increased maternal or fetal complications. This post summarized the July 2018 ACOG guidelines on low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy, which can be found here https://tinyurl.com/nt2zhdjm\n\nTaking low dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia is recommended by many health authorities including the American College of Obstetrics & Gynecology (ACOG), US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTP), and the World Health Organization (WHO). Your healthcare provider may recommend low-dose aspirin for the prevention of preeclampsia if you have one or more HIGH-risk factors or two or more MODERATE-risk factors. Please see slides five and six for what these high and moderate-risk factors are.\n\nYour healthcare provider (HCP) will recommend a dose between 80 -162 mg, ideally started between 11-16 weeks of gestation and taken before bed. Your HCP may then discontinue your low dose aspirin as different times, depending on your situation and preferences, but typically it is continued to at least 36 weeks of pregnancy. Speak to your provider about what option is best for you and if you should be taking low-dose aspirin.\n",

A total of 29,111 women were included in the full study cohort. Vaccinated pregnant women were 1:1 matched to unvaccinated women based on characteristics such as age, gestational age, residential area, population subgroup, and influenza immunization status. The main study group included 7540 vaccinated and 7530 matched unvaccinated women.\n\nOverall, COVID-19 infection occurred in 118 vaccinated women and 202 unvaccinated women following a median (i.e., the \u201cmiddle\u201d value that separates the higher half from the lower half in a data set) of 37 days post-vaccination. Among those infected, 88 of 105 (83.8%) were symptomatic in the vaccine group vs 149 of 179 (83.2%) in the unvaccinated group. The hazards (i.e. risk) of infection were 0.33% and 1.64% in the vaccinated and unvaccinated group, respectively. Vaccine-related adverse events were non-severe and reported by only 68 patients, the most common ones being headache, general weakness, non specified pain, and stomachache - all lasting less than 1 day!\n\nWhy is this study important??? While we have shared data supporting the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy and that pregnant individuals mount a good immune response after vaccination, there has been a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of the vaccine (it\u2019s been assumed by the good immune response) in reducing rates of infection among pregnant women - until now. \n\nBottom line: mRNA COVID-19 vaccination compared with no vaccination is associated with a significantly lower risk of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women.\n",

Many predicted that spending more time at home during the pandemic would lead to increased sexual activity and a \u201cpost-pandemic baby boom\u201d but what\u2019s really happening between the sheets?\n\nA study by Brotto et al., from UBC investigated the sexual health of Canadians during the pandemic. The study team surveyed >1000 Canadians (aged 19-81) on 4 facets (desire, behavior, compliance, coercion) of sexual health from April to August 2020 (important to note: the majority of respondents were heterosexual women).\n\nBottom line: This study contributes to well-established literature showing that the relationship between sexual desire and sexual behavior is NOT linear and positive, but rather complex and impacted by the environment. This suggests that there are factors contributing to sexual desire beyond the contribution of stress that must be considered in the context of COVID-19. It also highlights that increased supports for mental health and sexuality will be important to help re-cultivate sexual health as we move forward.\n\nOne important note of the study: While overall rates of sexual coercion were low in this study, COVID-19-related stress has led to increased rates of sexual violence. These results are concerning given the possible long-term effects of stress persisting post-pandemic and the recognized rise of intimate partner violence (IPV). *If you are experiencing IPV, please see our highlights titled \u201cIPV\u201d for resources.* \n\nSwipe through the slides to learn more about the findings in this study.\n\nYou can find the full study here: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19317611.2021.1947932\n\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

        "caption": "Have you ever wondered about what fibroids are and how they might affect pregnancy? \n\nUterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths of the smooth muscle layer of the uterus. They grow in various locations within the uterus and can vary in number, shape, size, and location. Fibroids are very common and occur in 70-80% of women by the age of 50. Many women have fibroids without having any symptoms. You may find out that you have fibroids during one of your pregnancy ultrasounds.\u00a0\n\nRisk factors for developing fibroids include: age, getting your period early (before age 12), women who have never had a baby, obesity, increased frequency of menses, family history of fibroids, and individuals of African/Black descent.\u00a0\n\nSymptoms that you may experience if you have fibroids include: heavy/irregular/long periods, pelvic pain/pressure, pain with sex, low iron or hemoglobin levels, increased urinary frequency (need to pee), constipation, and fertility issues.\n\nNot all fibroids cause infertility, however they can if in a submucosal (the space where the baby grows) location. In some studies, submucosal fibroids have shown to negatively impact fertility (getting pregnancy and staying pregnant). In patients with submucosal fibroids and no other cause for infertility, these fibroids can be removed surgically.\n\nThere are limited studies on how fibroids change in size throughout pregnancy. There is some evidence that if they grow, it tends to happen in the first trimester and then may shrink postpartum. Possible pregnancy complications from fibroids include: pain, early miscarriage, small babies (requiring more frequent ultrasounds), preterm labour, separation of the placenta from the uterus before birth, babies not being head down at the end of the pregnancy.\n\nIf you have previously had fibroid removal surgery (myomectomy), you may need a C-section for delivery. Depending on the size and location of the fibroids, your baby may not be head down at the end of pregnancy. Lastly, fibroids in the lower part of the uterus or cervix may block the ability to have a vaginal delivery. Talk to your healthcare provider to see if your fibroids may impact your mode of delivery.\n",

Recommendations on the timing of delivery are based on balancing maternal and fetal risks.\n\nThis study was conducted to determine if elective induction of labour (starting labour without a medical reason) during the 39th week of pregnancy (the week before the due date) would result in a lower rate of serious complications or death for babies around the time of delivery compared to the usual practice of waiting to induce labour until at least 5 days after the due date (40 weeks and 5 days). Researchers also wanted to know if inductions had an affect on the odds of Caesarean delivery.\n\nResearchers screened more than 50,000 individuals across 41 hospitals in the U.S. and identified eligible participants as being \u201cnulliparous\u201d (first-time mothers) and \u201clow-risk\u201d\u009d (carrying a single, head-down baby with no major medical conditions). Of those participants that were eligible and agreed to participate, 3062 pregnant women were placed into the induction at 39 weeks group (induced between 39 weeks and 0 days and 39 weeks and 4 days) while 3044 pregnant women were placed into the expectant management group. Expectant management meant that pregnant women would a) wait for labour to begin on its own; b) be induced for medical reasons at any point necessary; or c) be induced electively after 40 weeks and 5 days.\n\nWhat did the researchers find? Induction of labour at 39 weeks did not improve the outcome of perinatal death or serious complications in babies (i.e., there was no difference in this outcome between the induction group and expectant management group). For mothers, induction at 39 weeks compared to expectant management resulted in a LOWER rate of Caesarean delivery (19% vs. 22%) and a LOWER risk of developing pregnancy-related high blood pressure (9% vs. 14%). Mothers in the early induction group spent more time in the labour and delivery unit, but LESS time in hospital postpartum.\n\nContinued in comments below!\u2b07\ufe0f\n",

V-safe is a smartphone-based tool in the U.S. available for voluntary enrollment to those who have received the COVID-19 vaccine. Through text messaging and web-based surveys, v-safe is designed to provide personalized health check-ins following receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine. Those who reported they were pregnant at the time of vaccination were invited to enroll in the v-safe pregnancy registry, which involved telephone follow-ups each trimester, during the postpartum period, and 3 months following live birth. \n\nWhat are the results of this study? Among the 2,456 pregnant women who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine preconception or in early pregnancy (prior to 20 weeks\u2019 gestation), the risk of miscarriage prior to 20 weeks was 12.8% (age-adjusted). \n\nBOTTOM LINE: Compared to the miscarriage rate across all pregnancies (12.5%-18.7%), receipt of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine preconception or prior to 20 weeks\u2019 gestation is NOT associated with increased risk of miscarriage.

        "caption": "Multiple studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccination leads to the production of antibodies that are transferred in breast milk. For #medicalmonday, we are sharing this new study which found that the presence of antibodies against COVID-19 in breast milk was higher in mothers who had been lactating for greater than 23 months compared to those who had been lactating for less than 23 months. Study link https://tinyurl.com/284tcn6k\n\nFirst of all, we want to acknowledge that many people do not breastfeed this long, choose not to breastfeed or simply cannot breastfeed for various reasons.\n\nEven though these are interesting findings, it is important to acknowledge what we still do not know:\u00a0\n\n- How much breast milk is necessary to transfer a significant amount of antibodies from mother to child\u2028\n- The level of immunity that is conferred (i.e. is it robust or barely enough?)\u2028\n- How long the protection lasts\u00a0\u2028\n- Furthermore, the amount of antibodies taken in by a baby depends on the volume of milk they consume and the amount of antibodies that happen to be contained in that volume.\u00a0\n\nAlso important to note that:\n1. Antibodies in breast milk do not make it into the baby\u2019s bloodstream, but rather coat the mouth, throat and gut and then eventually get digested\u2028\n2. The antibodies on the mucosal surface work by fighting off infections at the body\u2019s entrance. This is different and less effective than being vaccinated in pregnancy, which can transfer antibodies into the baby\u2019s bloodstream\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\n\n- Presence of antibodies against COVID-19 in breast milk was HIGHER in mothers who had been lactating for greater than 23 month\u2028\n- However, it is important to remember that antibody transfer through breast milk confers only some level of immunity compared to a child being fully vaccinated or vaccination during pregnancy and there are many unanswered questions regarding the immunity conferred. More research is needed.\n\nFinally, we would also like to acknowledge that while we are sharing this information to keep everyone up to date on what we are learning about COVID-19 and perinatal health, breastfeeding is not an easy journey for many people for so many reasons\u2026\n",

They also have a higher frequency of pre-eclampsia, Cesarean delivery, and a higher rate of preterm birth.\u00a0\u00a0\n* Care of the critically ill pregnant patient with COVID-19 requires a multidisciplinary team that includes obstetrics, neonatology, anesthesia, infectious diseases, medicine, and critical care.\n* Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are safe to use among pregnant individuals and vaccination is highly recommended in this population.\u00a0\n\nKey messages:\n1. Despite the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and the increased risk for severe disease in the pregnant population, vaccine uptake in pregnant individuals is lower than other higher-risk populations.\u00a0\n2. Tailored messaging to increase vaccine confidence is needed \u2014 particularly considering more virulent Variants of Concern (VOCs).\u2028\n\n#PandemicPregnancy #PushingThroughThePandemic #duedateduringthepandemic #pregnancy #parenting #maternity #birth #newborn #postpartum #breastfeeding\u00a0\n#maternalheath #primarycare #obstetrics #covid19 \n\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

        "caption": "#MedicalMonday Today we are sharing a study published in @jamanetwork showing that many women changed their pregnancy intentions once the COVID-19 pandemic hit. In this study from New York, 1179 women who were mothers of young children (but not currently pregnant) were asked about their plans for pregnancy after the first wave of COVID-19.\n\nThe study found that many people who were thinking of getting pregnant or actively trying to get pregnant were no longer considering pregnancy once the pandemic was declared. Out of those who were not thinking about getting pregnant, only 4.5% had started considering it. Swipe through the slides to see the exact statistics.\n\nOut of those who changed their mind about pregnancy, those who STOPPED considering pregnancy were more likely to have public insurance, lower educational level, lower current financial security, or higher levels of stress. Finally, of those who were trying to get pregnant, Hispanic women were more likely to have stopped. Those who were newly thinking about getting pregnant were more likely to be non-Hispanic White.\n\nBottom line: This study showed that many women CHANGED their pregnancy intentions after the COVID-19 outbreak, and many were uncertain if their decision would change in the future. These uncertainties were associated with increased stress and financial insecurity. These findings are similar to what was seen during the 2008 economic recession and highlights the economic stress on women, especially working mothers and racialized women.\n\nWhat about Canada - did COVID-19 lead to a baby boom or bust? Canada-wide birth data for 2020 isn\u2019t available yet, BUT some places have reported a baby bust (although some hospitals have reported a 2021 summer baby boom).\n\nSwipe to the end for a sample of the questionnaire used in this study.

This day was created on June 5th 2021, following the devastating discovery of 215 children found at a former Kamloops residential school. To date, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission documented 4,118 children who passed away in residential schools. This number is continuing to grow as we learn more. \n\nIn honour of National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, we are sharing quotes from a recent Lancet commentary by Dr. Richardson and Dr. Boozary discussing the urgent need for reconciliation in Canadian health care.\n\nAs healthcare workers and allies, we must continuously ask ourselves what reconciliation means and what we can do to support decolonising work. While this commentary helps highlight these points, it also provides a brief history behind residential schools and an introduction into the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) report and Calls to Action.\n\nWe commit at PPG to take today and every day to learn about Indigenous histories and health. It is only together and through our collective knowledge that we can provide Indigenous peoples with the quality of care that is the right of every individual.\n\nDr. Richardson and Dr. Boozary conclude \u201cAll Canadians and the global community need to stand with Indigenous peoples so that our children and grandchildren can live together in health, dignity, and prosperity.\u201d \n\nTo read the full article, visit: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01953-X/fulltext\n\nLink to find TRC report and Calls to Action: https://nctr.ca/records/reports/\n\n#pandemicpregnancy #maternalhealth #indigenoushealth #truthandreconciliation\n",

Urine toxicology screening was performed in the prenatal period around 8 weeks gestation. Cannabis use was found to have increased from 6.75% pre-pandemic to 8.14% during the pandemic. According to their statistical analysis, this was equivalent to a 25% increase in cannabis consumption in pregnancy during the pandemic.\n\u2800\nCanadian data is currently limited. A smaller study of 7040 Canadian pregnant individuals found no increased use in cannabis consumption in pregnancy during the pandemic. However, this study was different in that it was a considerably smaller sample and based off of patient reports rather than urine tests.\n\u2800\nNevertheless, providers should continue to screen and counsel on cannabis use during pregnancy. Cannabis can contain over 400 active ingredients, some of which the effect on the fetus is unknown. The two main active ingredients, THC and CBD, are known to cross the placenta. Studies have shown an increased risk in low birth weight, stillbirth, preterm birth, and impaired neurodevelopment leading to long-term effects in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.\n\u2800\nBottom line: There is no known safe amount or duration of time of cannabis use during pregnancy.\n\u2800\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

In honour of Canadian #cervicalcancerawarenessweek (October 25-30, 2021) and #MedicalMonday, we are sharing this letter by Dr. Milena Forte and our own PPG student @laurdiamond that addresses the importance of catch-up vaccination programs.\n\nTeenagers who were scheduled to complete their vaccination schedule in 2020 or 2021 did not have access to their in school vaccinations due to the temporary suspension. Subsequently, attendance at catch-up vaccination clinics has been low. The main students affected by the suspension would have been in grade seven in the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic years. \u201cAdequate catch up vaccination is unlikely to happen without a coordinated, school-based approach.\u201d\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s also important to highlight that school-based vaccination programs allow for more equitable vaccine uptake.\u00a0 This is especially important given the well-established increased burden of cervical cancer and reduced cervical cancer screening in low-income communities.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe at @PandemicPregnancyGuide are advocating for women\u2019s health that the government and public health put a plan in place to catch up on the vaccination schedule.\n",

This means that Omicron has some concerning mutations that MAY be impacting the behaviour of the virus. While it is possible that these mutations could increase transmissibility of the virus or disease severity, we do not have enough evidence yet to say for sure.\n\nThere is some early evidence showing that current vaccines work to prevent severe disease from Omicron, but we need more research in this area as well.\n\nBottom line: There is a lot of ongoing research to better understand Omicron. We do not know how it impacts pregnancy or kids yet so please stay tuned. We will keep you updated as we learn more. And remember, all our public health measures still apply: wear a well fitted mask, practice frequent hand hygiene, self-isolate if you are sick/exposed, and avoid crowds when possible.

The study enrolled 30 lactating women who received an mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine (20 received Pfizer, 10 received Moderna) between January and April 2021. Serial milk samples were collected before vaccination, across 2-3 weeks after the first dose, and across 3 weeks after the second dose. Women also provided blood samples after the first and second dose. Stool samples from breastfed infants aged 7 days to 21.7 months old were collected 21 days after mothers received their second dose. These samples were compared to pre-pandemic samples of milk, blood, and infant stool from prior studies.\n\nMilk samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies against the COVID-19 spike protein and 4 variants of concern: D614G, alpha, beta, and gamma (delta was not tested). These new genetic variants of concern from the original COVID-19 sequence are associated with increased infectivity and enhanced transmissibility. Stool samples from 24 infants aged 55 days to 11 months were also assessed for detection of anti IgA and IgG antibodies.\u00a0\n\nIt was found that breast milk from vaccinated mothers contained elevated levels of antibodies against COVID-19 spike protein, resulting in significantly increased neutralizing ability as compared to their matched pre-vaccine milk samples. The neutralizing ability of milk was significant against the spike protein and all four VOCs, though there was\u00a0 considerable variability among women. Additionally, presence of antibodies against COVID-19 spike protein in the stool of breastfed infants was detected for the first time in a research study. Detection of these antibodies suggest potential protection of infants from COVID-19.\n",

The report indicates that the pandemic has had an impact on fertility planning amongst Canadians, which is evident in declining birth and fertility rates across the country. The report also outlines factors that might explain these changes to family planning, including economic factors, rising costs of living, access to social supports, and general uncertainty surrounding the changing conditions of the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot all Canadians are impacted by these factors in the same way - individuals without children, individuals from visible minority groups, and those living in Ontario were reported more likely to want fewer children or to delay having children. In a recent interview with @globalnews PPG\u2019s very own Dr. Tali Bogler comments on the impact she has seen within her own practice, with more families cancelling or delaying family planning, or making decisions to reduce initially-planned family sizes in response to pandemic-related factors.\n\nMost notably, it is likely that these declines in birth and fertility rates will be seen in population-level trends for years to come. Dr. Bogler explains that while delaying pregnancy by 1-2 is not something to be generally concerned about, the longer the delay (given that Canada is already a \"late-childbearing country\"), this might potentially lead to a growing number of individuals/couples encountering age-related infertility issues and not achieving their desired family size. \n\nHas the COVID-19 pandemic altered your fertility plans?

With Omicron surging and only about 70 per cent of pregnant people in Ontario having received two doses, Bogler has no plans to stop.\n\n\u201cWhen someone comes up to me at a mass vaccination clinic because they recognize me, and says \u2018Thank you. I\u2019m here because of you,\u2019 that is the most meaningful to me. That is what keeps me going.\u201d\n\n\u2014Megan Ogilvie\"\n",

Research shows that when vaccinated in pregnancy, antibodies can last in the infant for the first few months of life.\n\nPregnant individuals have some of the lowest rates of vaccination in the province, despite their risk of severe illness if infected with COVID-19. It is strongly recommended that pregnant individuals get their COVID-19 vaccine, including their booster (third-dose) which they are eligible to receive three months after their primary series (i.e. first and second dose). There is no \u201cright\u201d trimester to get vaccinated.

There are three studies from 3 different countries that we present that all show similar findings: the COVID-19 vaccine was not associated with major or long-lasting changes to the menstrual cycle.\u2757\ufe0f\n\n\u27a1\ufe0fTwo of the 3 studies showed that the COVID-19 vaccine produced minimal changes to menstruation and one of the studies showed NO impact.\n\u27a1\ufe0fThe most recent study published in Obstetrics and Gynecology (Study #3)\u00a0 found a small statistically significant increase (i.e., periods were approximately 0.5 days longer after the 2nd vaccine and closer to 2 days if both doses were given in the same cycle); however, this change was short lasting and period lengths returned to normal in subsequent cycles. While some media headlines have obscured this finding saying that the study showed \u201can IMPACT on menstruation,\u201d it is important to distinguish between statistical significance and clinical significance. In the context of menstrual cycles, clinical/medical significance is when someone has an increased menstrual length by more than 8 days.\u00a0\n\u27a1\ufe0fThe study did not investigate changes to period heaviness or cramping (which anecdotally, we know people have reported)\u00a0\n\nThese studies bring up a really important lesson for clinical research: the effects of medical interventions on menstruation should not be an afterthought, and instead, monitored in future research and clinical trials, including trials of COVID-19 vaccines. This information is important to allow patients to plan for potentially altered cycles if applicable. We applaud the scientists who contributed to these studies and investigated this potential association -\u00a0 concerns regarding menstrual changes post-vaccination are important! Further well-designed prospective studies, similar to Study #3, are needed in order to further study other outcomes like menstrual heaviness, which have been reported online as well.\n",

For #MedicalMonday, we are breaking down a recent study that shows that the COVID-19 vaccine does NOT impact fertility.\u00a0\n\n\u203c\ufe0fTLDR; a prospective cohort study found:\u203c\ufe0f\n-no association between female and male partner fertility following COVID-19 VACCINATION\n- no association between female fertility following COVID-19 INFECTION\n- short-term (<60 day) association between male partner fertility following COVID-19 INFECTION.\n\nThe study recruited 2,126 females aged 21-45 years old, who were living in United States or Canada, and trying to conceive without fertility treatment. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and then completed follow-up questionnaires every 8 weeks over the period of December 2020 to September 2021. The comprehensive questionnaire asked about COVID-19 infection and vaccination status, sociodemographic (i.e., household income, education, health insurance, etc.), and lifestyle information (i.e. partner information, body mass index, intercourse frequency, doing something to improve chances of conception, sleep duration), and many more variables! Patient partners (male) were also invited to participate and complete the questionnaire.\u00a0\n\nThe authors then took all of these variables and created several models to assess whether the variables (i.e., vaccination, infection, and fertility) were related and/or whether the other information collected (i.e., the socioeconomic and lifestyle information) explained the trends seen.\u00a0\n\nThe study found (1) that COVID-19 vaccination status had no association with reduced fertility in either female or male partners, (2) that COVID-19 Infection was not associated with declined female fertility, and (3) that COVID-19 Infection was associated with short-term (<60 days) decline in fertility for male partners who tested positive. However, it is important to note that the short-term decline in male fertility following a COVID-19 infection was not seen in all male partners infected with COVID-19. It is also important to not that there was NO ADVERSE association between COVID-19 Infection and male fertility >60 days after infection.\u00a0[1/2]\n",

For #MedicalMonday, we are sharing a recent cohort study of 110 women (the largest number of breast milk samples analyzed to date from women with recent COVID-19 infection) that found no infectious COVID-19 virus in the breast milk of lactating individuals. This indicates that recent COVID-19 infection or detection in human milk is not a contraindication to breastfeeding.\n\nSo, what should you do if you are breastfeeding and have Covid-19?\nHere are 10 helpful tips. Thanks to lactation consultant, @Sofyabrainin for reviewing.\n\n1.\tDon\u2019t panic - keep calm and feed on (we have evidence that infectious virus is not found in breast milk)!\n2.\tWear a good mask (ideally KN95/N95) when caring for your baby and while breastfeeding.\n3.\tPractice good hand hygiene before and after caring for baby.\n4.\tMonitor your baby for signs/symptoms of COVID-19.\n5.\tProtect your supply by drinking lots of fluids, rest, and adequate breast stimulation (pump as much as you can (only if you can) approximately 8 sessions/day & 10-15 mins/session). If your supply dips while you are ill, don\u2019t worry, you can get it back up once recovered.\n6.\tDon\u2019t worry if you can't breastfeed while ill, you can always pick it up once you are feeling better. If you are ill, but able to, pump at least 4x/day to help prevent against engorgement/mastitis. \n7.\tIf you are too ill to breastfeed, ask another adult to feed and care for your baby.\n8.\tStored breast milk/formula can be used as a suitable alternative while you are ill.\n9.\tReach out to your healthcare provider if you need additional support around feeding or with you or your baby\u2019s health.\n10.\tRemember, if you got vaccinated in your pregnancy, your baby likely has antibodies against COVID-19.\n\nDisclaimer: The general information provided on this account is for informational purposes only and is not professional medical advice, diagnosis, treatment, or care, nor is it intended to be a substitute therefore.

This data set gives us the first preliminary findings on this issue, but more data will continue to help clarify.\n\nTo look at this question they compared the odds of the pregnant person having completed two doses mRNA vaccine series during pregnancy if their child under 6 months was hospitalized with COVID-19 between July 2021-Jan 2022.\n\nHaving received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in pregnancy was associated with decreased risk of hospitalization in babies less than 6 months after birth. Vaccine effectiveness was as indicated below:\n\n> Anytime in pregnancy: 61%\n> Before 20 weeks: 32%*\n> 21 weeks or later: 80%\n\nLimitations:\n> Could not look at omicron specific data. \n> Did not include women vaccinated before pregnancy but boosted during pregnancy. \n> Data set was small, so unable to get more accurate results on differences in what trimester vaccine was administered in. \n> Did not take into account prior infection (aka hybrid immunity).\n> Could not account for potential differences in behavior of the pregnant person. But they did control for age, admissions date and race.\n\nWe have ample data that being vaccinated in pregnancy reduces risk to the pregnant person and their unborn child. We also know that the baby receives antibodies through the placenta that persist after birth. \n\nThis data set, while small, gives us some of the first data suggesting how much protection those passive antibodies might supply. We need more data to clarify this issue and also look at how a booster may impact these results. \n\nHowever, we have SO MUCH DATA showing the benefits and safety of vaccines for COVID-19 in pregnancy, this is one additional benefit that should be considered. \nIf you're pregnant, please get vaccinated - for yourself and for your baby.\n",

We acknowledge that many other Black individuals have made significant contributions to the field of Obstetrics & Gynecology, and medicine at large, that have never been recognized. We hope to continue to recognize the incredible impacts made by Black figures to women\u2019s health throughout Black History Month and beyond.\n\n1. Anarcha Westcott, Lucy Zimmerman and Betsey Harris: Mothers of Gynecology\nAnarcha, Betsey and Lucy were three enslaved women who worked on plantations in Alabama in the 1840s. James Marion Sims, who is credited as the \u201cfather of modern gynecology\u201d performed surgeries on these enslaved Black women, amongst many others, without pain medication, operating under the racist notion that Black people did not feel pain. Sim\u2019s work revolutionized surgical treatments for women, however it must be acknowledged that these advancements were made through the exploitation of Black female bodies.\n\n2. Dr. Helen Octavia Smith (1909-2001): Advocate for Contraception and Sexual Health\nHelen Octavia Dickens earned her M.D. at the University of Illinois in 1934 as the only African-American woman in her class. She specialized in Obstetrics & Gynecology and became the first African-American fellow of the American College of Surgeons. She led extensive research into teen pregnancy and sexual health issues and advised schools, parents and health professionals on intervention strategies to reduce the incidence of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.\n\n3. Henrietta Lacks (1920-1951): Immortal Cells that Changed Medicine.\nHenrietta Lacks was a Black patient who was diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer at one of the few hospitals that served Black people in Maryland. Unknowingly, her cells were used for research as they were found to be unique in the way they survived and reproduced. Her cells, now known as HeLa cells, have been used to develop vaccines, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and much more, making them one of the greatest discoveries in modern medicine.\n\n#bhm\n",
